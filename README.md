# Portfolio

This project is a portfolio of my work. It is a working project.

## Description

I created this portfolio to showcase my work as a beginning web developer. During this project I have challenged myself to expand my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

I started this bootcamp with basic knowledge of web development, so to expand my knowledge I used the following concepts in this project:

- CSS Grid
- CSS Variables
- Responsive sizing for text and images
- Hover effects

It took several tries and many tears but I researched, studied, and implemented CSS Grid as the framework for this project. I also learned how setting up a color scheme as variables is helpful when designing a beautiful look.
